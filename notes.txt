Rules of Hooks:
1. Don't call hooks inside loops,conditions,or nested functions.
2. Only call hooks from react functions.

useState: 
1. Add state to functional components.
2. Make sure to spread your state variable and then call the setter function.

useEffect:
1. Lets you perform side effects in functional components.
2. Its a close replacement for componentWillMount,componentDidUpdate & componentWillUnmount.

useContext:
1. Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

useReducer:
1. A hook for state management.
2. Alternative to useState.
3. useState is built using useReducer.
4. useReducer(reducer,initialState)
5. When to use? 

useReducer with useContext:
1. useReducer - local state management
2. Share state betweeen  components - Global state management
3. useReducer + useContext


HOOKS SO FAR:
useState - state
useEffect - side effects
useContext - context API
useReducer - reducer
